*** Compose message service

The client submits messages like this:

PUT /outbox
{
	to: ['dest1', 'dest2'],
	message: {
		subject: 'Greetings',
		body: 'Hello there. This is a greetings email'
	}
}

The agent processes the message. For each destination it wraps the message in a package like the following:

{
	destination: 'dest1',
	message: {
		subject: 'Greetings',
		body: 'Hello there. This is a greetings email'
	}
}

and places this bundle in the outboxQueue couch db.

Also, the agent upon receiving a valid message it returns the couch doc it to the client.
